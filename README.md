# Hello, World

Mainly focused on Front-end Development with a good UI/UX eye and always trying different things.


### Some facts:
- ☕ &nbsp;I do like coffee but I'm not a typical (addicted) coffee lover like many developers claims to be
- 🔍 &nbsp;Doing a Google Search for the difference between _substring vs substr_ is something that I've already accepted in my life
- :pencil2: &nbsp;I always fail to type Enviroment... ***Environment** ( always miss the tricky "n" :angry: )
- 🛑 &nbsp;There's no point on the **spaces vs tabs** discussion, everyone knows that the latter is the wrong answer
- 🎯 &nbsp;As you, I have the "never-finishing" issue when working on side-projects
- 🏳️ &nbsp;In the JS famework war I support JavaScript
- 🗣️ &nbsp;I speak 3 languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) and also JavaScript.
