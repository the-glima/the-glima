<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Gabriel Lima</h2>
<h3 align="center">Front-end Developer</h3><br><br>

#### Where you can find me
On Twitter at [@__glima](https://twitter.com/__glima), where I tweet mostly about Front-end Development and Web Development. And on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel--lima/). you can check my detailed work experience.

#### My tech stack
JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, HTML, Web Components, Angular, React, Vue, Jest/Cypress/Postman, Bash Script, VSCode, Git, iTerm/Zshell, Worked with Linux and Windows but I love Unix Environment (macOS), UI/UX, Docker, CI/CD, Functional Programming, Design Patterns, SOLID, KISS, DRY and POLA.

#### Some facts:
- ☕ &nbsp;I do like coffee but I'm not a typical (addicted) coffee lover like many developers claims to be
- 🔍 &nbsp;Doing a Google Search for the difference between _substring vs substr_ is something that I've already accepted in my life
- :pencil2: &nbsp;I always fail to type Enviroment... ***Environment** ( always miss the tricky "n" :angry: )
- 🛑 &nbsp;There's no point on the **spaces vs tabs** discussion, everyone knows that the latter is the wrong answer
- 🎯 &nbsp;As you, I have the "never-finishing" issue when working on side-projects
- 🏳️ &nbsp;In the JS famework war I support JavaScript
- 🗣️ &nbsp;I speak 3 languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) and also JavaScript.
