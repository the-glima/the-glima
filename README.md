You can find me at [@__glima](https://twitter.com/__glima) on Twitter where I tweet mostly about Front-end Development and Web Development.
For my detailed work experience you can check my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel--lima/).

My tech stack: JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS/SCSS, HTML, Web Components, Angular, React, Vue, Jest/Cypress/Postman, Bash Script, VSCode, Git, iTerm/Zshell, Worked with Linux and Windows but I love Unix Environment (macOS), UI/UX, Docker, CI/CD, Functional Programming, Design Patterns, SOLID, KISS, DRY and POLA.

### Fun (not so fun) facts:

- 🔍 &nbsp;Doing a Google Search for the difference between _substring vs substr_ is something that I've already accepted in my life
- :pencil2: &nbsp;I always fail to type Enviroment... ***Environment** ( always miss the tricky "n" :angry: )
- 🛑 &nbsp;There's no point on the **spaces vs tabs** discussion, everyone knows that the latter is the wrong answer
- 🎯 &nbsp;I have the "never-finishing" issue when working on side-projects
- 🏳️ &nbsp;In the Angular vs React vs Svelte vs Vue framework war I support JavaScript
- 🤮 &nbsp;I hate having to clean up the rest of the food in a kitchen sink 
- 🌎 &nbsp;Dear North Americans fellows: stop calling yourselves Americans, thanks.
- 🗣️ &nbsp;I speak 3 languages and also JavaScript.
